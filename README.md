## What is Global Library
Global Library is an open-source library and a side project that aims to assist Product Designers to start a project quickly with comprehensive, cohesive, and consistent UI components across all platforms. The goal is to provide a library of reusable yet flexible design components and guidelines that can be easily implemented by development teams, using [design tokens](https://github.com/chongchizhang/token). 

### Scalability
Global Library is highly scalable, allowing for the rapid creation of new features and mockups. All of the design components have been designed to work together seamlessly, ensuring that new components can be added without compromising the overall design aesthetic. It is platform-agnostic, meaning that it can be used across a range of platforms, including web, iOS, Android, and desktop. This enables the consumers to provide a consistent user experience across all devices, improving usability and reducing cognitive load for their users. 

### Flexibility
While consistency is important, I also recognize that every product has unique needs. To accommodate this, Global Library is highly customizable. Designers can easily modify components to suit their specific requirements, without sacrificing the overall consistency of the design. To achieve that, it leverages the latest Figma features like Auto Layout, Component Properties, Expose nested instances, Prefered Values, etc... In addition, design tokens are also set to be scalable and flexible; for example, in the semantic or theme tier of the tokens, we support the color theme, platform theme, and density theme for different needs. 

### Accessibility
Global Library is built on a foundation of accessibility, scalability, and consistency. I understand that accessibility is a key consideration for many products, and their end users come from a diverse range of backgrounds and abilities. It is my responsibility to create a library that is accessible to everyone. To achieve this, I have designed the components with accessibility in mind, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines for contrast, color, and text legibility. It is important to note that colors are created with a contrast-first approach, and font stacks leverage the operating system's default font recommendation. 

## How to use global library
Global Library will soon be publsihed on Figma Community. This means that anyone can copy, remix, and contribute to the library, as well as report issues ([GitHub](https://github.com/chongchizhang/global-library/issues) or [Form](https://forms.gle/g6V8N9XnmMbhxCDm6)) and suggest improvements through our [Project Management tool](https://github.com/users/chongchizhang/projects/1).
